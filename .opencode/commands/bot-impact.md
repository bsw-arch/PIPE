description: "Analyze impact of bot changes"
---

I'm planning to modify or remove the following bot:
$BOT_NAME

Use the `analyze_bot_impact` tool to:

1. Identify all bots that depend on this bot
2. Categorize by risk level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
3. Assess the blast radius of changes
4. Recommend testing strategy
5. Identify potential breaking changes

Then provide:
- A risk assessment summary
- Required updates to dependent bots
- Testing checklist
- Rollback plan if needed
- Timeline estimates for safe deployment

Be specific about which bots in which domains will be affected.
