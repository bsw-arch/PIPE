Find bots similar to:

$DESCRIPTION

Use the `find_similar_bots` tool and `query_bot_knowledge` to:

1. Find bots with similar functionality across all domains
2. Compare their approaches and implementations
3. Identify reusable patterns
4. Suggest which bot to use as a template

Then provide:
- Top 5 most similar bots with similarity scores
- Key differences in their approaches
- Pros and cons of each approach
- Recommendation: which bot to reference or extend
- Code patterns that can be reused

This helps avoid reinventing the wheel and promotes consistency across the bot factory.
