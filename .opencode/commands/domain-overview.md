Provide a comprehensive overview of the $DOMAIN domain.

Use the `get_domain_overview` tool and `query_bot_knowledge` to:

1. List all bots in this domain
2. Identify the most complex bots (by dependencies)
3. Identify the most critical bots (by dependents)
4. Show domain-specific patterns and conventions
5. Highlight key documentation and guides

Then provide:
- Domain purpose and scope
- Total bot count and key bots
- Architecture patterns used in this domain
- Inter-domain dependencies
- Common workflows
- Development guidelines for this domain
- Related documentation links

This helps developers understand the domain's role in the bot factory and how to contribute effectively.
